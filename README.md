**Google Drive File Management Script**

**Overview:**

This Python script provides automation for managing files in Google Drive using the PyDrive library. It enables users to rename PDF files based on information extracted from the file contents and move them to specific folders within Google Drive.

**Features:**

1. **Authentication**: Authenticates with Google Drive using OAuth 2.0 credentials stored in a file named "mycreds.txt".
2. **File Management**: Renames PDF files in a designated folder to "aaa.pdf" in Google Drive.
3. **Information Extraction**: Extracts file name, date, tag number, and directory information from PDF file contents.
4. **File Movement**: Moves renamed PDF files to destination folders based on the extracted directory information.
5. **Local Cleanup**: Deletes local copies of PDF files after renaming and uploading them to Google Drive.

**Usage:**

1. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed, including PyDrive, fitz, and glob.
2. Authenticate with Google Drive by running the script and following the authentication prompts.
3. Specify the target folder in your Google Drive where the files are located (e.g., "SERVICE").
4. Run the script to rename and move the files in the specified folder.
5. Review the console output for status messages and confirm that the files have been successfully managed.
